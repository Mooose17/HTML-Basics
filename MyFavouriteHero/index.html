        <li>He’s very polite, caring, and strong-willed.</li>
        <li>Sometimes he can be dramatic, and often he is loud during battle.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Deku's Friends</h2>
    <P>Let’s start with his first friend: Bakugo.
        I’m not going to talk much about his friendship,
        because I talked about it in the last section.
        So just go read that. But, Bakugo was his childhood ‘friend.’
        Because of his narcissistic attitude and Deku’s lack of a quirk,
        Bakugo easily became Deku’s #1 bully.
        I already explained how this relationship affected him.
